## Usage

There are two possible use cases that depend on the usage of a CSS preprocessor like SASS. If you are using SASS, you should copy the content of the `sass` folder to your CSS files, otherwise copy the content of the `css` folder. Done, both version will override the CSS rules of your embedded Gist snippets.
