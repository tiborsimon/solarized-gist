## How to use the themes?

There are two possible use cases that depend on the usage of a CSS preprocessor like SASS. If you are using SASS, you should copy the content of the `sass` folder to your CSS files, otherwise copy the content of the `css` folder. 

You are done. Both versions will override the CSS rules of your embedded Gist snippets.



## Contribution

Feel free to fork and contribute to this project, as the CSS class mapping between Pygments and the Gist CSS may not cover your particular needs.
