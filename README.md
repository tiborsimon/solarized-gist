## How to use this theme?

- __Using regular CSS__ - copy the content of the `css` folder to your site's CSS folder and link it to your pages.
- __Using CSS preprocessors__ - copy the content of the `sass` folder to your CSS files and link it to your pages.

And you are done. The included CSS files will override the CSS rules of your embedded Gist snippets.
