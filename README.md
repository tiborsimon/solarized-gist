## How to use the themes?

- __Using regular CSS__ - copy the content of the `css` folder to your site's CSS folder and link it to your pages.
- __Using css preprocessors__ - copy the content of the `sass` folder to your CSS files and link it to your pages.

You are done. The included CSS files will override the CSS rules of your embedded Gist snippets.



## Contribution

Feel free to fork and contribute to this project, as the CSS class mapping between Pygments and the Gist CSS may not cover your particular needs.
